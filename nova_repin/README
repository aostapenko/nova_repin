Nova Repin
---------------
A small tool for correcting nova pinning information for mis-deployed compute nodes.

This branch is only tested on the OpenStack Kilo release.

Usage
---------------
This tool assumes you have already compiled a list of instances that were scheduled with the wrong pinning information.

- Update /etc/nova/nova.conf with the correct vcpu_pin_set setting

- Restart nova-compute

- run nova_repin on a controller node for any affected instances

- hard reboot the instances to be re-pinned

Example Usage
--------------

// Unsetting instance cpu pinning:
controller# ./nova_repin.py unpin <instance-uuid>


// Setting cpu pinning for unpinned instance:
controller# ./nova_repin.py pin <instance-uuid>


// Recalculating and setting instance cpu pinning if calculation was successful:
controller# ./nova_repin.py repin <instance-uuid>
